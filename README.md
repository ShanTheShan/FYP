To install and use the application on your physical Android device via APK, download it [here.]

To run the source code, follow the steps below:

1. To build the project locally on your machine, clone the **_build_** branch and install the dependencies via `npm install`.
2. Connect your physical device to your machine via USB and enable debugging mode. Learn how to enable debugging mode [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7nkxS9LMXs) **OR** launch an emulator via Android Studio.
3. Use Expo CLI to run a local build (recommended way) via `npx expo run:android --device` or Expo Go(via the npm start script).

Refer to Expo CLI docs for more info: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/
